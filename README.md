Need to change the Ai / the win condition using the Magic Square type sol<br /> 
ie <br /> 
Making a 3X3 matrix in which every triplet adds up to 15 and when any player has 15 as the total score he will win else he will loose
<br /> 
# square<br /> 
 2 7 6<br /> 
 9 5 1<br /> 
 4 3 8<br /> 
here every triplet adds up to 15 and if a player gets 15 score he wins
this will reduce the complexity of the algorythm and will allow faster smaller and more intresting approach to the problem
